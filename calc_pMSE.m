%function [pMSE, MSE] = calc_pMSE(R,yhat)
%
% This function returns the peak mean square error (pMSE) between the
% predicted firing rate yhat and the neural data provided in R. The pMSE is
% defined as the MSE calculated for those time bins, in which the recorded
% firing rate y (mean of R over trials) is at least two standard deviations
% above its mean over time.
%
% Inputs:
%
% R		should be a NxT matrix (N: number of trials, T: number of time
%		bins) in which each row is the spike train of a given trial. Each
%		element R(n,t) thus contains the number of spikes that were
%		recorded during time bin t in trial n.
%
% yhat	should be a vector with T elements. It contains the predicted
%		firing rate over time.
